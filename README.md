### Glad to see you here!

Born in September 2002, I grew up with a sense of hope and a bright future.
I started programming at home at the age of 14 and taught myself.
Until today, I have been able to learn and use many basics and topics in different fields. The ability to be full-stack in projects and to be able to collaborate and the necessary abilities for development and open-mindedness.
By learning the security issues of the server, the ability to program the API along with the relevant document, I am familiar with working with databases and database topics, and I am able to manage data banks.
I have more interest and mastery in API programming.
